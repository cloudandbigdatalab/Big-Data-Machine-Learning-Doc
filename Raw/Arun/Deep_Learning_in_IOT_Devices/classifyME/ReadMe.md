## A Raspberry Pi Powered Project to show the viability of the concept of IOT + Deep Learning in the Cloud. 

In house deep-learning or deep-learning in the edge is what we want as it is much more powerful and at the same time quicker than cloud
solutions. However, in cases where many number of IOT devices, spread across a geographical location, need to make decisions based on certain 
criteria populated by a deep-learning model, a unified cloud solution is required.

*classifME* is a python app which is written with simplicity in mind. It is a barebone with potential to be expanded to various dimensions.

Thanks.
