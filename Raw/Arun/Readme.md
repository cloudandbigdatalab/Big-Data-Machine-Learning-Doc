##Update 1
* Uploaded Caffe Tutorial.
* Tutorial focuses on Classification of images and is based on Caffe's own example.
* A trained model is used to classify an image of users choice.
* The Notebook is well documented with comments and details about key terminologies.
* References are included for better/deeper understanding of the same.
* Next phase will be to define my own Neural Network.

##Update 2
* New example has been added to *Deep Neural Network with Caffe (1).ipynb* file.
* *Deep Neural Network with Caffe (1).ipynb* will cover both example 1 and 2. 
* A markdown version of the notebook is available in the *MD Files* folder.

##Update 3
* Added an image file which summarizes the basic architecture of Caffe.

##Update 4:
* Installed caffe in a spark cluster utilizing CaffeOnSpark by yahoo!
* Set up 2 capable servers with packages required for caffe and tensorflow.

##Update 5:
* Caffe, Tensorflow examples carried out in GPU Nodes.
* CaffeOnSpark examples have been carried out.
* Successfully built an app for Image Classification. More info here: https://github.com/arundasan91/classifyME

##Working on:
* Integrating Deep Learning in IOT devices like *Raspberry Pi*.
* Working on an iOS app integrating Tensorflow to make an Image Classification Engine
